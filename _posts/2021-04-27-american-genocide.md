Yes, we should [recognize the American Genocide](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/biden-recognized-armenian-genocide-now-recognize-american-genocide-n1265418).

> Some may try to argue that what took place in the U.S. shouldn't qualify as genocide, given that Native Americans still live here.

I also want to point out that a [2018 survey found that nearly 40% of Americans don't believe that Native Americans even *exist*](https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2018/08/07/survey-people-think-natives-dont-exist-arent-discriminated-against/923250002/).
