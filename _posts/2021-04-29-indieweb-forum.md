Here's an idea: an IndieWeb-driven forum. Anyone writes a post. They can then syndicate (like [here](https://news.indieweb.org/how-to-submit-a-post)) with a u-syndication class to the forum. 

The forum server would need to:
Process top level posts, could integrate categories also
Process in-reply-to webmentions to the right top level post
Need to decide if threading would be important or not, and maybe just one level
Process likes/favorites/bookmarks to those posts
