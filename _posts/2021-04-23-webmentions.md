I added webmentions to my site today! I found [@leonp's](https://micro.blog/leonp) [post](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/posts/adding-webmentions-to-jekyll-an-overview/) which made it all really easy. 

I haven't automated rebuilds or sending yet, that will still be manual for now...but nothing wrong with incrementalism!
