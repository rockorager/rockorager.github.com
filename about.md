Hello! I am Tim. You've stumbled upon my website, welcome!

You might be wondering why I have this, instead of just using Facebook or something else. Well, let me tell you!

First of all, the ads are getting downright creepy.

Second, this site is built using principles from the [IndieWeb](https://www.indieweb.org), which I find to be really awesome.

Third, well. I once spent a road trip as a kid *hand-writing* HTML for a website. It's just always been something I enjoy, so this is just a fun project for me.

I've mostly stopped using Facebook, except for some occasional professions of love for my wife, and photos of our kids and dog. I'm intending to migrate most of my web-life over to this. 

## Behind the site

Since this is built around IndieWeb stuff, I figure most of the people looking at this will be from there...so you might be interested in how it's all pulled together:

- **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** for hosting
- **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** for building the site. I'm a huge fan of [plain-text](https://plaintextproject.online/), so Markdown files were a must. And given that hosting on Github Pages is so easy with Jekyll...it was a natural fit.
- **[Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/)** for receiving webmentions
- **[Netlify-CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)** for the front-end, or...
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** for markdown and all coding. I also use VS Code extensively for personal and work notes.
